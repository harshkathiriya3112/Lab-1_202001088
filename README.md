# **Exercise : 1**
### **Functional Requirements:**
* Authentication should be done whenever a user logs into the Library Information System.<br/>
* If a user is not registered in the system, and tries to sign in then he/she should be asked to sign up and after signing up, a verification email should be sent to the user.<br/>
* User should be able to see the availability of the book that he/she wants.<br/>
* The librarian should be given administrative privileges, so that he/she can enter the new record of the book when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.<br/>
* Only registered members can borrow books from the library information system. In case, any non-registered person tries to borrow the book, he/she should be asked to first register.<br/>
* If the person doesn’t return the book on time then he/she should be asked to submit the valid reason.If the valid reason is not submitted then he/she won’t be allowed to borrow the book for a few days. Library management system will be unavailable for him/her during this time.<br/>
* The Library Management system should be shut down in case some hacker tries to change the data on the web application.<br/>
* Any non-member person should also be able to search and view the books of the library management system.<br/>
* If the user is a professor and he/she wants to borrow the book then priority should be given to him/her. After the book is available, it should be assigned to the professor first by the system. <br/>
* A user should be shown all the book details that he/she has borrowed from the library and how many days have left to return it.<br/>
* A system should make sure that it runs on the institute LAN only, if someone tries to access the system from any other network, then the system should give an error message.<br/>

### **Non-Functional Requirements:**
* The system should be able to perform the desired tasks in reasonable time.<br/>
* The system should not store the confidential information of the user like passwords, etc. in the plain text. All such information should be stored in the encrypted manner for security purposes.<br/>
* The system should be user-friendly and provide a graphical user interface.<br/>
* The system should be scalable to support an extended number of users.<br/>
* The system should be easy to maintain and update. New updates should not harm the current running system.<br/>
* The system should perform desired tasks with accuracy like user registration, information regarding issue operation, return status, user validation and authorization etc. <br/>
* The system should be portable so moving from one OS to another OS does not create any problem.<br/>
Any non-administrative person should not be able to update any information regarding books on the system. <br/>




# **Exercise : 2**
### **Scope:**
A sound-recognition system for the deaf and hard of hearing community is given. The system uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community such as car horns and babies where immediate alerts and continual logging is critical for the user. The deaf community has benefited from this system, in the area of sound amplification and speech to text conversion.

### **Functional Requirements:**
* The user should be able to specify the type of resulting tone and length. Also can select the type of output for some specific inputs (vibration, just tone, vibration and tone both)<br/>
* The user should be able to select the voices from the list of the voices that are recognized by the system.<br/>
* The user should be given authority to change the settings including select voice type, select the tone with result.<br/>
* The user should be able to add and delete the voices in the list.<br/>

### **Non-Functional Requirements:**
* The system should recognize any voices from the list without any fault.<br/>
* The system performance should not decrease with time or by usage.<br/>
* When some error happens, Meaningful notification should be displayed.<br/>
* It should support adding new voices without changing current voices.<br/>
* The system should be compatible within all mobile devices.<br/>
* The system should be flexible and scalable so it can fit any voice.<br/>
* Every user must have a unique identification.<br/>
* All desired operations must be completed in a few seconds. <br/>
